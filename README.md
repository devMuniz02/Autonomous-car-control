## Project Overview
This project provides the codebase to control a Hiwonder car autonomously. The system integrates motor control, sensor feedback, and navigation algorithms to achieve autonomous movement.

---

## Features
- **Motor Control**: Manage precise movements and speed of the Hiwonder car.
- **Sensor Integration**: Utilize sensors for obstacle detection and path correction.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Navigate predefined routes or respond dynamically to the environment.
